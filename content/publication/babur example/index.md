abstract: The miticide effect of lithium on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) parasite Varroa has been discovered. Varroa mite is considered the principal threat to bee health and, as a result, to pollination and food security. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of lithium on honey bees, specifically locomotor activity (LMA) level and circadian patterns of LMA, such as rhythmicity, and periodicity. Any effects of lithium on activity may be important for bee health since timing and daylight are critical for bee foraging and beeâ€™s use of the sun compass for navigation and communication. Both acute and chronic lithium treatments affected the LMA of honey bees. The effect varies depending on light and dark conditions. Chronic treatment with lithium disrupted the rhythmicity and altered the period of the circadian rhythm. While the circadian period was not affected by the light condition in the control group, lithium treatment lengthened the period in constant light condition. Lithium decreased total LMA in a constant light condition where typically activity is increased and not under the dark condition, both in acute and chronic treatments. However, mortality in the high-dose lithium treatment group is higher in the dark environment in the acute experiment. Lithium is also the first-line therapy for bipolar disorder. This disorder causes excessively elevated activity called mania and circadian rhythm abnormalities. The effects of lithium on reducing light-induced activity and the circadian rhythm of bees are reminiscent of its stabilizing effect on activity and circadian rhythms in bipolar disorder treatment.
